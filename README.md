# paratrooper
## Motivation and Explanation
Our goal was to center our learning around a memorable experience. We wanted the experience to have unique and recognizable sound,
and a dynamic environment. We felt that sky diving satisfied these requirements.

We then decided to choose the location of the sky dive to be the [Great Blue Hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blue_Hole).
From the start, we knew the location of the sky dive had to be a recognizable location, because sky diving into a generic environment
isn't as interesting. We decided on the Great Blue Hole in particular because of its size and how it's recognizable even from high
in the air. 

At the end of the experience, we wanted our user to have a greater understanding of the steps taken in sky diving, along with some insight
into the mechanics of skydiving (for example, time spent in free fall, height to dive from, how sound changes when parachute deploys).

The user begins inside a small plane circling the Great Blue Hole.
A voice in the user's ear gives some introductory information, with sound effects meant to emulate the effect of a radio transmission, then
the door to the plane opens and the user jumps out of the plane. On the way down, the user is given instructions on how to safely complete
the sky dive.

## The Experience
## Technical Explanation
- Gravity was simulated using a RigidBody on the player
- Movement occurred by applying forces to the RigidBody
- The effect of a parachute was simulated by applying drag to the RigidBody
