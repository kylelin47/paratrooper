<a id="motivation-and-explanation" class="anchor" href="#motivation-and-explanation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation and Explanation</h2>

<p>Our goal was to center our learning around a memorable experience. We wanted the experience to have unique sound
and a dynamic environment, so that it would be easily recognizable. We felt that sky diving satisfied these requirements. The visual
of falling through the clouds, and seeing the ground from so high that its features appear flat should evoke strong reaction and
imagination from the user. The sound of the wind rushing by quickly in free-fall contrasted with the relative calm of the parachute
flapping in the breeze should do the same. We decided we would teach about the basic knowledge required in order to safely sky dive.</p>

<p>We then decided to choose the location of the sky dive to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blue_Hole">Great Blue Hole</a>.
From the start, we knew the location of the sky dive had to be a recognizable location, because sky diving into a generic environment
isn't as interesting. We decided on the Great Blue Hole in particular because of its size and how it's recognizable even from high
in the air.</p>

<p>At the end of the experience, we wanted our user to have a greater understanding of the steps taken in sky diving, along with some insight
into the mechanics of skydiving (for example, time spent in free fall, height to dive from, how sound changes when parachute deploys).</p>

<p>The user begins inside a small plane circling the Great Blue Hole.
A voice in the user's ear gives some introductory information, with sound effects meant to emulate the effect of a radio transmission, then
the door to the plane opens and the user jumps out of the plane. On the way down, the user is given instructions on how to safely complete
the sky dive.</p>

<p>After the VR experience, users will be able to demonstrate understanding of the key steps needed in order to sky dive.</p>

<a id="environment-design" class="anchor" href="#environment-design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Environment Design</h3>

<ul>
<li>Care was taken to scale objects appropriately to each other</li>
<li>Ambient sound effects are present and make sense to the situation</li>
<li>Audio is spatialized</li>
<li>Clouds are used as wayfinding aids

<a id="education-results" class="anchor" href="#education-results" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Education Results</h2>
<p>Before trying our project, our first participant rated her knowledge on parachuting as 2, 1 being having no knowledge and 5 being very knowledgeable on the subject. She relayed that she knew that to parachute, you jump out of a plane and has seen some movies on the subject. After the experience, she rated her knowledge on parachuting as a 3. She has said that she now knows that you have to release your parachute at a certain altitude.</p>
<p>After three participants tried the project, they answered a SUS questionnaire. The average of the responses for each result is below:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Please rate your sense of being in parachuting, on the following scale from 1 to 7, where 7 represents your normal experience of being in a place.
    <br>1 - not at all ... 7 - very much </li>
  <p> Average Response: 3.66 </p>
  <li>To what extent were there times during the experience when parachuting was the reality for you?
    <br>There were times during the experience when parachuting was the reality for me...
    <br>1 - at no time ... 7 - almost all the time. </li>
  <p> Average Response: 4.66 </p>
  <li>When you think back about your experience, do you think of parachuting more as images that you saw, or more as somewhere that you visited?
    <br>1 - images that I saw ... 7 - somewhere that I visited </li>
  <p> Average Response: 5.33 </p>
  <li> During the time of the experience, which was the strongest on the whole, your sense of parachuting, or of being elsewhere?
    <br>I had a stronger sense of
    <br>1 - being elsewhere ... 7 - being in the parachuting </li>
  <p> Average Response: 2 </p>
  <li>Consider your memory of parachuting. How similar in terms of the structure of the memory is this to the structure of memory of other places you have been today? By "structure of the memory" consider things like the extent to which you have a visual memory of parachuting, whether that memory is in color, the extent to which the memory seems vivid or realistic, its size, location in your imagination, the extent to which the memory seems vivid or realistic, its size, location in your imagination, the extent to which it is panoramic in your imagination, and other such structural elements.
    <br>I think of parachuting as a place in a way similar to other places that I've been today
    <br>1 - not at all ... 7 - very much so </li>
  <p> Average Response: 4 </p>
  <li> During the experience I often thought that I was really falling in parachuting
    <br>1 - not very often ... 7 - very much so </li>
  <p> Average Response: 2 </p>
</ol>
